# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code, please submit a Pull Request with the changes you would like to make.

Please use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure your code is in a similar style to the rest before submitting your PR. Use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure a consistant style. The `.prettierrc.json` and `.eslintrc.json` files are included in the repo

I will likely merge your PR if it works as intended and does not break other features.
